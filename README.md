# Low-Level Design (LLD) Projects with React

Welcome to the repository dedicated to creating **Low-Level Design (LLD)** projects using **React**. This repository is created to showcase and practice various LLD concepts by building small, reusable, and scalable projects. 

## Projects

### âœ… Completed Project: Toast Notification
The first project added to this repository is a **Toast Notification**. It is a simple, customizable notification system that can be used to alert users about various actions or events. 

- **Features**:
  - Configurable position, duration, and appearance.
  - Animation for showing and hiding notifications.
  - Auto-close after a set duration with a smooth animation.
  - Dynamic notification updates (can be customized with content and styles).

## Future Projects

In the future, I plan to add many more **Low-Level Design projects** to this repository. The goal is to keep building small projects that demonstrate fundamental concepts of LLD and how they can be implemented in **React**.

Some of the upcoming projects might include:
- Modal windows
- Dropdown menus
- Carousel/Slider
- Form validation systems
- Tabs
- Sudoku
- Customizable tooltips
- And many more...

Each project will be designed with a focus on **scalability**, **reusability**, and **best practices** in React development.
